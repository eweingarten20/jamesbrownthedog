Hi! My name is James Weingarten.

  I have a ton of friends, my best
   friends are Teddy and Charlie Schwartzberg.Teddy is a goldendoodle and Charlie is a half schnoodle/ half goldendoodle. How crazy! I love going over to the Schwartzbergâ€™s house and playing in their big backyard, it is always a blast.I love to play with other puppies but my favorite people to play with are most definitely my family.I have four sisters, who cuddle with me all of the time and rub my white belly.I am also a huge fan of my parents, especially of my dad, Ian. We are the only boys in the house so we get along pretty well.
I go on many adventures. My parents sometimes take me to my grandparents beach house in Ventura. In the past, I have visted the Brentwood Country Mart, Century City Mall and Montana Ave.
